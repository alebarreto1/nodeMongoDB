## NODE.JS: API REST COM EXPRESS E MONGODB


Completing this @Alura course allowed me to create a REST API to register books and authors, using good programming practices.
In the execution of the project, a CRUD was created, which, through the mongoose library, was connected to the MongoDB database.
In addition, http verbs were used to search for books and authors, register them, update and delete them.
In this process, the nodemon library, responsible for the live reload of the code, deserves to be highlighted.
And, in the end, an association was made between two entities in MongoDB (books and authors) using the populate resource.
